In this folder I've updated two of my recent projects that I did for learning purposes.
1. CNN based Breast Cancer Detection: I did similar project with Federated Learning last semester. But Accuracy was bit lower and needed to work with the model more. After that I worked on improving model performance and now the CNN based model is much better than before in case of accuracy and prediction. I'm still working on this project and planning to submit the conference paper.
2. CNN on Chest X-ray to detect Pneumonia: This project is similar to the first project. I worked on this for learning purposes. 

Moreover, during this semester I did some extra courses related to Machine Learning and Data science from Datacamp. I've attached my completion certificates in a separate folder here. Completion dates are mentioned in the certificates. Coures are :
1. Cleaning Data in Python
2. Feature Engineering in ML
3. ML with Tree Based Model
