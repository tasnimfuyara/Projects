In this folder I've updated two of my recent project that i did for learning purpose.
1. CNN based Breast Cancer Detection: I did simillar project with Federated Learning last semster. But Accuracy was bit lower and needed to work with the model more. After that I worked on improving model performance and now the CNN based model is much better than before in case of accuracy and prediction. I'm still working on this project and planning to submit the conference paper.
2. CNN on Chest X-ray to detect Pneumonia: This project is simillar to the first project. I worked on this for learning purpose.
